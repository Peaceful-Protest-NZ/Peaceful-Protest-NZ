# Peaceful Protest - Aotearoa New Zealand

**11/03/2022**
## What this site is for
The vision for this site is for it to play a role in facilitating peaceful protests in Aotearoa New Zealand. How it might eventually do that will be discussed in the [section below](#facilitateHow), and if you're interested in joining in this mission, that's discussed [here](#theMission). I value peace over violence, and I believe the vast majority of Kiwis do too. 

## How this site might help facilitate peaceful protest {#facilitateHow}
A chance to be heard and engaged with.

## A community project {#theMission}
This project has just started today! I thought, "fuck it, I'll buy the domain, and just start setting shit up". If you're interested in getting involved and co-designing this, please do! I have no experience in setting up a community project on Github so someone with experience in that would be great in the early stages.
