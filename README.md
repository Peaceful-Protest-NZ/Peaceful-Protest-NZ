# Peaceful Protest - Aotearoa New Zealand

**11/03/2022**
## What this site is for
The vision for this site is for it to play a role in facilitating peaceful protests in Aotearoa New Zealand. How it might eventually do that will be discussed in the [section below](#facilitateHow), and if you're interested in joining in this mission. I value peace over violence, and I believe the vast majority of Kiwis do too.

A chance to be heard and engaged with.
